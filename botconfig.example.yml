# lykos configuration file
# Common values are commented below, but not every valid configuration is present in this file.
# For documentation on all valid configuration elements, see https://ww.chat/config
# To configure your bot, COPY this file to "botconfig.yml" and customize it to your liking.
# When adding additional lines to this file, ONLY USE SPACES TO INDENT, NEVER TABS;
# our configuration reader is picky and indenting with tabs or not matching surrounding indents will cause errors.
# If you need additional assistance with formatting for this file, look up YAML syntax on your favorite search engine
# or come talk to us on chat.freenode.net #lykos

# The file named botconfig.yml is always loaded. A secondary file can be loaded as well which will
# overwrite settings in the main botconfig.yml file, based on command line switches.
# Running `wolfbot.py --config foo` will attempt to load botconfig.foo.yml if it exists.
# For convenience, the --debug switch implies --config debug as well

# The transports section defines all of the connections your bot will make.
# At least one transport must be defined for the bot to successfully run.
# An example transport is provided below; you can tweak it for your own network.
transports:
  - type: irc
    # Name of this transport. Can be anything, but must be defined and unique across all transports in this file.
    # Many other config sections let you specify a transport for something; those must match the name of a transport
    # defined here.

    # What IRCd the remote is running. Configuring this wrong will have disastrous consequences.

# Bot access. Access entries specified here cannot be modified or removed via the fflags command.
# However, that command may add additional access entries.
# By default, the following templates are defined:
# owner => full access to the bot and can execute every command
# admins => access to manage moderators and execute commands which can update the bot's code or cause it to restart
# moderator => manage games in progress and warn users, but cannot manage access entries or cause the bot to restart

# Logging. The bot can log data to files as well as to destinations on transports (such as IRC channels).
# This section configures what gets logged and to where the logs are sent.
# By default, the following groups are defined:
# admin-commands => logs all usages of all admin commands
# warnings => logs all usages of the fwarn commands which add/delete/modify warnings
# debug => logs all exception reports
logging:
  logs:
    # A log can be sent to a destination on a transport. Exactly how this works depends on the transport in use.
    # For IRC, the destination must be either the main channel or an alternate channel in the transport config.

# Telemetry. lykos sends error details to the developers to help provide a better and more stable bot.
# To help preserve the privacy of your users, we anonymize data by default. However, opting in to sending us
# more data can help us solve errors faster or know how to prioritize development efforts.
# To send more data to the lykos developers, uncomment the following block:
#telemetry:
